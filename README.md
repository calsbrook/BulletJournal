### Intro
Bullet journaling helps a user organize their tasks, events, and notes in a way that helps you stay on top of everything.  This app includes many ways to view your data but also keeps things lightweight and simple so that you don't get overloaded with interface.  Its meant for speed and at a glance understanding.

### Habit Tracker

A habit tracker helps you make and keep good habits.  You check off each day that you meet a habit goal which makes you more accountable.

### Technologies Used
This app was built using Ruby and Rails.  It helped me understand the way databases can be related as well as provide a relatively simple platform to quickly make the app.  I also used an amazing gem called [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar).

### Unsolved Problems
I wanted extra functionality on the Habit Tracker.  Ideally when you hover over a habit it would hide the boxes of all the other habits on the calendar.  This would help you see only one habit when you want to.

### Future Features
I would like to add tags for your notes so that you could organize your notes into projects.  I'd also be interested in adding checklists within notes with a bar that shows the percentage of the tasks you've completed.
